## Title: 
### *Visualization of Spatial data models: from theory to practice*

## A brief biography of the instructors:


*Simina Boca* is a Biostatistician in Early Biometrics & Statistical Innovation, Data Science & Artificial Intelligence, R & D, Astrazeneca. Her interests include exploratory data analysis and data visualization, high-dimensional analysis, and data integration.

*Federica Gazzelloni* is a Statistician and an Actuary with international experience. As a collaborator of the [IHME](https://www.healthdata.org/), she is interested in the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD). She is also a volunteer of the [R4DS community](https://rfordatascience.slack.com/) where she enjoys tutoring statistics while learning advanced techniques. More information about her ongoing-projects can be found at: [GithHub repository](https://github.com/Fgazzelloni). Twitter: @[fgazzelloni](https://twitter.com/FGazzelloni)


## The broad topic it covers

The application of basic modeling techniques to spatial data for making beautiful maps will empower users knowledge and ability in making useful data visualizations. In addition, to become able to present data evolution through map visualizations will improve the strength on making advanced analysis, and reducing the time consuming in understanding spatial applications but selecting just the important features for the scope.

The competition of this tutorial will enable the participants to:

- Manage data for making spatial analysis
- Apply modeling techniques for spatial analysis
- Make a spatial model visualization



## Abstract

A visualization of spatial data modeling will be presented. The data are selected from the {SpatialEpi} package which contains different data set for modeling the epidemic of leukemia and some specific type of cancers identified in specified locations, such as Scotland, New York, and Pennsylvania. 
The data sets contain the number of cases, the expected number of cases as well as the geo-data with the latitude and longitude and the polygons for representing the geometry of the locations to be used for making a map.
A visualization of a spatial model involves making a model of the coordinates to predict an outcome. This type of technique can be used for several purposes, for this tutorial epidemic data will be used, with the aim to understand the pattern of a disease through a map of the cases versus the number of expected cases.
Some interesting work in the literature of spatial modeling have been made with the use of more complicated models, for example, a Poisson model is suggested for forecasting the epidemic patterns through the use of spatial data visualization, but in this tutorial, a simple linear model will be presented for educational purposes and to make the approach to spatial modeling smoother for all the users. 
The tutorial will also focus on using {ggplot2} package for spatial data, highlighting basic differences with other packages. To conclude, the visualization will be added with some extra features with the help of {cowplot} package and made available in a .png format. 



## Intended audience and prerequisites

### Audience:

User of R with less than 1 year of continual experience, will gain confidence as well as direct information on how to make a map and model spatial data.  

The tutorial is also for users with more than two years of continual experience, who are interested in spatial model visualizations.

### Prerequisites:

- Knowledge of different R data types & structures such as the difference between numeric and character values, what is a data frame and a vector, etc.

- Knowledge of the difference between the base and the {ggplot2} approaches to data visualizations.

- Basic knowledge of modeling with R, such as what is a model, why models are useful, what is an outcome and a predictor.

- Basic knowledge of a GitHub repository, such as how to get access to data, etc.

### Computing requirements:

Participants should have a laptop with access to the internet. Installation of R is not required but recommended; the participants can use RStudio Cloud workspace. A GithHub account would be suggested.

#### Required R Packages:

- {SpatialEpi} package of methods and data for spatial epidemiology
- {tidyverse} which include {ggplot2} for making data wrangling and visualizations
- {maps}, {tmap}, {sf}, {rnaturalhearth} for spatials
- {tidymodels} for modeling
- {patchwork}, {cowplot} and {ragg} for final touches of the visualization


## A brief outline of the tutorial

### Session 1 (40 minutes): Manage data for making spatial analysis

- Introduction of the tutorial and the instructors, biographies and the course content that will be used during the course (such as the GihHub repository, the data to use)
- Introduction to spatial data with {ggplot2} with a visualization of a map made from a dataset selected from {SpatialEpi} package.
- Advice on different packages for making the same visualization, such as {maps},{sf},{tmap}.

**Break 15 minutes & QA**

### Session 2 (40 minutes): Apply modeling techniques for spatial analysis

- Introduction to modeling with RStudio, base R modeling, liner models structure 
- Advice on how to use {tidymodels} for eventually use different types of models
- Example of spatial model

**Break 15 minutes & QA**

### Wrap-up (10 minutes): Make a spatial model visualization

ðŸŽ£ Make the map visualization, add final touches with {cowplot} and save it as .png file.

### Participants Pratice session (30 minutes):

- Access to the GitHub tutorial repository: https://github.com/Fgazzelloni/tutorials
- Load the data from {SpatialEpi} package
- Apply the code taught in the previous sessions
- Save the work on a .png file
