## Title:

**Modeling Spatial analysis data visualization: from theory to practice** 

## Audience:

- Basic user of R (less than 1 year of continual experience)
- Advanced user of R (more than two years of continual experience)

What is required: 

- understanding of different R data types & structures such as the difference between numeric and character values, what is a data frame and a vector, etc.
- understanding of the difference between base plot() function and the use of {ggplot2} package
- basic knowledge of modeling with R, such as what is a model, why a model is make, what is an outcome and a predictor
- basic knowledge of a GitHub repository, such as how to get access to data, etc.


## Instructor background:

*Federica Gazzelloni* is a Statistician and an Actuary with International experience. She is one of the IHME collaborator, and a coauthor of the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD). Her first language is Italian, she also speaks English in a professional manner. More information about her ongoing projects can be found at: https://github.com/Fgazzelloni

## Domain:

Data used in the tutorial will be selected from past TidyTuesday and various R packages which make map data available, no spatial knowledge is required.

## Points of appeal:

The application of basic Modeling techniques to Spatial data for making beautiful maps will empower users knowledge and ability in making useful data visualizations. In addition, to become able to present data evolutions through map visualizations will improve strenght on advanced analysis, reducing the time consuming in understanding spatial applications.

## Learning objectives:

The completition of this tutorial will let the participants to be able to:

1.  Manage data for making spatial analysis
2.  Apply modeling techniques for spatial analysis
3.  Make a spatial model visualization 

## Computing requirements:

Participants should have a laptop with access to the internet. 
Installation of R is not required but reccomended; the participants can use RStudio Cloud workspace. 
A GithHub account would be suggested.

Required R Packages:

- Tidyverse which include ggplot2
- some of these packages: maps, tmaps, sf, rnaturalhearth, ...
- Tidymodels
- Cowplot


## Lesson plan:

The tutorial will be taken in two main sessions with a break of 15 minutes each. 
At the end of the second break the tutor will wrap-up the two previous sessions with a final spatial visualization.
The tutorial will continue with a third session which will be entrirely practice, the participants will be provided of a new data set, very alike the one presented, and have the chance for making their own *Spatial Model Visualization*.

### Session 1 (40 minutes):

- Intro to the GitHub repository, and the contents that will be used during the tutorial
- Intro to **Spatial with ggplot2**
- Overwiew of the available packages for doing Spatials with ggplot2
- Example of Spatial DataViz

#### Break 15 minutes

### Session 2 (40 minutes):

- Intro to **Modeling with RStudio**
- Overview of the available packages for Modeling with RStudio
- Example of Modeling

#### Break 15 minutes

### Wrap-up (10 minutes):

ðŸŽ£ Making a sample of a **Modeling Spatial** analysis data visualization using proposed "data" and save it on a .png format.

### Pratice Part (30 minutes): 

- access to the GitHub tutorial repository: https://github.com/Fgazzelloni/tutorials
- a simple data set provided in tidy format in the data folder
- apply previous code to the data
- save the work on a png file


## Other considerations:

The participants should have forked the repository, make a project
