## A brief biography of the instructors:

*Federica Gazzelloni* is a Statistician and an Actuary with International experience. She is one of the [IHME](https://www.healthdata.org/) collaborator, and a coauthor of the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD). She is a volunteer of the [R4DS community](https://rfordatascience.slack.com/) where she enjoys tutoring statistics while learning advanced techinques.

## The broad topic it covers

### Domains:

Data used in the tutorial will be selected from past [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) and various R packages which make maps data available, no spatial knowledge is required.

### Points of appeal:

The application of basic Modeling techniques to Spatial data for making beautiful maps will empower users knowledge and ability in making useful data visualizations. In addition, to become able to present data evolutions through map visualizations will improve the strenght on making advanced analysis, and reducing the time consuming in understanding spatial applications but selecting just the important features for the scope.

### Learning objectives:

The completition of this tutorial will let the participants to be able to:

- Manage data for making spatial analysis
- Apply modeling techniques for spatial analysis
- Make a spatial model visualization

## Abstract (250 words max)



## Intended audience and prerequisites

### Audience:

- Basic user of R (less than 1 year of continual experience)
- Advanced user of R (more than two years of continual experience)

### Prerequisites:

- Knowledge of different R data types & structures such as the difference between numeric and character values, what is a data frame and a vector, etc.
- Knowledge of the difference between base `plot()` function and the use of {ggplot2} package
- Basic knowledge of modeling with R, such as what is a model, why a model is make, what is an outcome and a predictor
- Basic knowledge of a GitHub repository, such as how to get access to data, etc.

### Computing requirements:

Participants should have a laptop with access to the internet. Installation of R is not required but reccomended; the participants can use RStudio Cloud workspace. A GithHub account would be suggested.

#### Required R Packages:

- {tidyverse} which include {ggplot2} for making data wrangling and visualization
- {maps}, {tmap}, {sf}, {rnaturalhearth} for spatials
- {tidymodels} for modeling
- {cowplot} and {ragg} for final touches of the Spatial visualization

## A brief outline of the tutorial

The tutorial will be taken in two main sessions with a break of 15 minutes each. At the end of the second break the tutor will wrap-up the two previous sessions with a final spatial visualization. The tutorial will continue with a third session which will be entrirely practice, the participants will be provided of a new data set, very alike the one presented, and have the chance for making their own Spatial Model Visualization.

***

### Session 1 (40 minutes):

- Intro to the GitHub repository, and the contents that will be used during the tutorial
- Intro to Spatial with ggplot2
- Overwiew of the available packages for doing Spatials with ggplot2
- Example of Spatial DataViz

**Break 15 minutes**

### Session 2 (40 minutes):

- Intro to Modeling with RStudio
- Overview of the available packages for Modeling with RStudio
- Example of Modeling

**Break 15 minutes**

### Wrap-up (10 minutes):

ðŸŽ£ Final touches with {cowplot} and save the sample Spatial Visualization of the Spatial data visualization model analysis.

### Participants Pratice session (30 minutes):

- Access to the GitHub tutorial repository: https://github.com/Fgazzelloni/tutorials
- Open up the data folder for downloading the .csv file (the data set is in a tidy format)
- Apply the code taught in the previous sessions
- Save the work on a .png file

***

## Other considerations:

The participants should have access to the GitHub repository for the tutorial, and be able to download data, as well as copy and paste the code presented during the tutorial into their own Rstudio workspace, so to be able to use the new dataset provided for practicing along with provided code.
